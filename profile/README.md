**Hello World!**

<p align="justify">
We're from <strong>C23-PS078</strong>, a team consisting of six talented people from Indonesia participating in a program called <a href="https://g.co/bangkit"><strong>Bangkit</strong></a>. We're currently creating a prototype of an application that streamlines the process of planning hangouts through a reliable recommendation model that shows the best local hotspots near you along with a straightforward voting system to supply your group decision-making needs.

<p align="justify">
<strong>HangoutYuk!</strong> (or <strong>HaYuk!</strong>) is the solution to easily planning hangout events with your friends and family. Everyone is longing to reunite with their loved ones after the pandemic, but with the overwhelming (or limited) amount of information that is available, the process of planning hangouts can be challenging and time-consuming for most people, leading to the outcome of cancelled plans and unrealized reunions. With HaYuk!, there is no need to worry any longer, as it provides the necessary features for users to effectively gather with their acquaintances in a streamlined manner at a place that fits everyoneâ€™s needs. Additionally, HaYuk! closely works with business SMEs to support the development of digital tourism and enhance the economic development of nearby communities.

## Our Team
   
<p align="justify">
The <strong>C23-PS078</strong> team is formed of three different learning paths in a cross-functional teamworking environment, with each learning path having different tasks and roles in the development of the HangoutYuk! application. 
In layman's terms, the learning paths of our team can be categorized into the following:
</p>
 
<p align="justify">
<strong>Cloud Computing</strong> provides the underlying infrastructure architecture of the app. Develops the backend APIs needed for the app, deploy cloud services, models, and backend APIs as needed by the team, documenting API using Swagger and use the Google Maps API to retrieve relevant information on local hotspots.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>Machine Learning</strong> builds and develops the recommendation model of hangout places based on several variables, such as distance and analysis of comments using NLP. Building model with TensorFlow, using ML Endpoint to deliver recommendations, and preprocess the data using pandas.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>Mobile Development</strong> builds the user-friendly design interface that seamlessly integrates all of the app's features using Figma. Develops the Android app using Android Studio as the development environment and Kotlin as the programming language, using the APIs developed by the Cloud Computing team alongside the endpoint models of the Machine Learning team.
